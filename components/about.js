            <p>I am a full stack developer with a background in media sales and creative writing. My career in sales has given me invaluable experience executing the demands of numerous clients while simultaneously meeting managementâ€™s expectations. My talent as a writer helps me come at problems from a more creative angle and, combined with my hard skills, allows me to emphasize aesthetic as well as functionality.</p>
